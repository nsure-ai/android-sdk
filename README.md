### Step 1: Add nSure SDK to your app

Add it in your root **build.gradle** at the end of `repositories`:

```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Add the dependencies:

```gradle
implementation 'com.github.nsure-ai:android-sdk:1.3.10'
implementation 'com.fingerprint.android:pro:2.8.0'
```

### Step 2: Add screen-capture permission

In your **AndroidManifest.xml**, add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.DETECT_SCREEN_CAPTURE" />
```

This permission is required for nSure to detect when the user takes a screenshot.

### Step 3: Initialize

Initialize nSure with your application context:

```java
NSure nSure = NSure.getInstance(this.getApplicationContext(), "SAMPLE_ANDROID_APP_ID", "PARTNER_ID");
```

### Step 4: Retrieve device ID from the SDK


The merchant has to retrieve the device id from the sdk and pass it to the merchant's server. The merchant's server has to add this device id in every call to nSure servers. The request body should contain the device id under a property called sessionInfo. 
For example sessionInfo:
```json
{ "deviceId": "user-device-id" }
```
Java method access:
```java
NSure.getInstance().getDeviceId()
```
